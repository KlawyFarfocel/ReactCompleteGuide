# Notes
### Refs
Refs can be used to simplify components, while managing state in it
Ref holds value and are managed by React
Use it by adding "ref" property to React elements
First, you have to access current property of ref

Takes much less space than setStates - should not manipulate DOM through refs

States causes component re-execution - Refs don't
States should be used for data reflected UI
Refs on gaining access to direct dom elements

### Portals
Portals are used to rendering components somewhere else id DOM tree
